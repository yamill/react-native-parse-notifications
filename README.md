# react-native-parse-notifications
Parse.com Notifications for React-Native

I’m using this for my React-Native App http://www.wpvapp.com

I’ll update this readme with setup + examples when I have some
time. If you’re already familiar with modules and the parse api this should be pretty
simple to get up and running.
